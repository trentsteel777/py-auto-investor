The main key to this is to pick WINNING STOCKS

Add in a much bigger universe of stocks

Add more metrics to output
    Total trades
    Biggest drawdown
    Peak portfolio value

Add in experimenter to fine tune SStopLoss__ parameters
    rerun across:
        self.stop_price percentage
        self.lower for RSI
    results should print
        the best paramaters across the greatest number of stocks that will work favourably 
            in different market conditions 

What's the expected value of the strategy? historical annual percentage return
